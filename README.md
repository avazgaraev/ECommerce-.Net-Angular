Using the Onion Architecture, ensuring a clean separation of concerns and maintainability. At the core, I defined the Domain layer, where I structured business entities, interfaces, and domain logic independently from other layers. The Application layer handles use cases and application logic, using DTOs to manage data flow and potentially implementing CQRS to separate read and write operations.

For data access, I set up the Infrastructure layer, integrating Entity Framework Core for database interactions and implementing repositories that follow interfaces from the domain layer. This layer also manages authentication with JWT, logging, and external service integrations like payments or email notifications. The Presentation layer exposes API endpoints through ASP.NET Core Controllers, handling HTTP requests efficiently and interacting with the application layer via dependency injection.

I ensured Fluent Validation is in place to validate incoming data before it reaches business logic. If required, I used MediatR to manage request handling in a structured way. Security is a priority, so I implemented role-based authorization to control access to sensitive endpoints. Configuration settings, including database connections and authentication parameters, are handled via appsettings.json to ensure flexibility across environments.

The project follows best practices for exception handling middleware, ensuring errors are managed consistently. I also integrated Swagger (OpenAPI) to document the API for better usability and testing. With Git version control set up, the project is structured for easy deployment and collaboration on GitHub. If needed, I can further optimize the API by implementing caching, background jobs, or improving database indexing.
